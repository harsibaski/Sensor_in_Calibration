# Sensor_in_Calibration


Demonstrates one technique for calibrating sensor input. The sensor readings
  during the first five seconds of the sketch execution define the minimum and
  maximum of expected values attached to the sensor pin.

  The sensor minimum and maximum initial values may seem backwards. Initially,
  you set the minimum high and listen for anything lower, saving it as the new
  minimum. Likewise, you set the maximum low and listen for anything higher as
  the new maximum.

  The circuit:
  - analog sensor (potentiometer will do) attached to analog input 0
  - LED attached from digital pin 9 to ground through 220 ohm resistor
